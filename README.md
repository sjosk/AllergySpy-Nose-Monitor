# ðŸ¤§ Allergy Spy Nose  
NASAL ALLERGEN DETECTORâ€‹   
>Ah-Choo!  
## Background  
Inspired by the concept of an electronic nose applied to environmental monitoring, this project originates from my own experiences with severe nasal allergies. â€‹ 
Living in a city with high pollen and dust levels has made managing my allergies a daily challenge, driving my need to constantly monitor the air quality and humidity in my home to reduce allergy triggers.â€‹  
## Crafting a Nose-Friendly Haven!  
A device that can detect common airborne allergens, humidity, and alert user to take preventive actions, such as cleaning or ventilating the area. This will help in maintaining an allergen-free environment at home.â€‹  
## Materials  
- Microcontroller Board: Arduino Unoâ€‹  
- Sensors: Dust Sensor GP2Y1010AU0F, DHT22 â€‹  
- Actuators: NeoPixel LEDâ€‹  
- Passive Components: Resistors, Capacitor â€‹  
- Display: OLED Display
