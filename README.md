# ðŸ¤§ Allergy Spy Nose  
NASAL ALLERGEN DETECTORâ€‹   
>Ah-Choo!  

The 'Allergy-Spy Nose' is an innovative device designed to enhance indoor air quality by detecting airborne allergens. Rooted in addressing severe nasal allergies, this system synergizes a particulate matter sensor (GP2Y1010AU0F) and a DHT22 sensor with an Arduino Uno microcontroller. It offers real-time air quality monitoring, visually represented via an OLED display and a colour-coded NeoPixel LED array. This device is tailored to improve living conditions for allergy sufferers, epitomising the integration of environmental sensing technology in health-centric applications. This report explores the deviceâ€™s design, functionality, and potential impact on allergen detection, underscoring its significance in environmental health management.  
## Background  
Inspired by the concept of an electronic nose applied to environmental monitoring, this project originates from my own experiences with severe nasal allergies. â€‹ 
Living in a city with high pollen and dust levels has made managing my allergies a daily challenge, driving my need to constantly monitor the air quality and humidity in my home to reduce allergy triggers.â€‹  
## Crafting a Nose-Friendly Haven!  
A device that can detect common airborne allergens, humidity, and alert user to take preventive actions, such as cleaning or ventilating the area. This will help in maintaining an allergen-free environment at home.â€‹
